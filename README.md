# FBREF-Soccer-Statistics-Scraper

Used Python's Scrapy to extract data from a soccer statistics website where I scrapped the profiles from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at the following links
using ethical web scrapping practices:

Lionel Messi: https://fbref.com/en/players/d70ce98e/all_comps/Lionel-Messi-Stats---All-Competitions

Cristiano Ronaldo: https://fbref.com/en/players/dea698d9/all_comps/Cristiano-Ronaldo-Stats---All-Competitions

This was the first step to analyzing the data and start my analysis for my Messi vs Ronaldo Dashboard Page.

Make sure to run the files in the following order:

1. messi.py or ronaldo.py (Scrapy python code to scrape FBREF)

2. data_cleaner.py(Cleans data that is scraped)
